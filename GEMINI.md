# Project Overview

This project is a collection of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks designed to teach the fundamentals of the Python programming language. The files cover basic concepts such as variables, data types (strings, lists, dictionaries), and control flow (if statements, while loops).

## Directory Overview

The `codes` directory contains the following files:

*   `01_variables_string.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook demonstrating the use of string variables.
*   `02_variables_list.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook explaining lists and how to use them.
*   `03_variables_dict.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook covering dictionaries.
*   `04_variables_bundles.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook demonstrating how to bundle data in lists and dictionaries.
*   `05_ifs.py`: Python script showing how to use `if` statements.
*   `06_whiles.py`: Python script demonstrating `while` loops.

## Usage

These files are intended to be used as learning materials for beginners in Python. You can run the `.py` files directly from the terminal or use a Jupyter Notebook environment to interact with the `.ipynb` files.
